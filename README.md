Hi, I am Joseph Caldwell and I graduated Persevere Code Camp at the end of 2019. I received my Full-Stack Developer Certification at the age of 49.
It was my proudest accomplishment to be able to learn all this technology to build Web sites & Mobile Apps, using a multitude of languages and environments.
As any developer knows, to most of us it don't come easy. Since graduating, I worked at Banyan Labs building Web Pages for a while and then moved on to Mobile Apps with React-Native
( React-Native(expo) & React-Native cli). I also studied 3D animation & modeling using Blender, six months later moved over to After Effects. Love all the Adobe Apps, you can build marvelous things with Adobe.
Since learning to write code in several different languages, I have become very passionate about developing. I learn as much as I can everyday and still practice what I have already learned. After all it is all 
about repetition. Your brain does not work as good when your older,it does make it harder learning and retaining it. It is a wonderful feeling of accomplishment when you are stuck on a problem and aafter hours of trial & ERROR & research, you finally figure it out.
