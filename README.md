Hi, I am Joseph Caldwell and I graduated Persevere Code Camp at the end of 2019. I received both my Front End Certification & Back End Certification. Although since then i haven't really done a whole lot of back-end,
but have remained focused on the front-end more. Being 51 years of age, it is a proud accomplishment just being able to learn all the different languages and being able to build Web Sites & Mobile Apps.
As any developer knows, to most of us it don't come easy. Since graduating, I worked at Banyan Labs building Web Pages for a while and then moved on to Mobile Apps with React-Native
(pure React-Native & React-Native cli). I also studied 3D animation & modeling using Blender, six months later moved over to After Effects. Love all the Adobe Apps, you can build marvelous things with Adobe.
Since learning to write code in several different languages, I have become very passionate about developing. I learn as much as I can everyday and still practice what I have already learned. After all it is all 
about repetition. I have found that in the development world, most individuals are nice and very helpful. I am open to any input from more seior developers on career paths, writing code,
great sites, etc.. If i can help someone with any projects, etc., give me a shout on linked in. Would love to donate some time and coding knowledge to a non-profit or charity.
